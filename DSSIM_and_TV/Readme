#DSSIM plus TV Losses

The combination of DSSIM and TV loss function is a way to train a model to generate images that are similar to the input but with improved 
clarity and sharpness. DSSIM measures the structural similarity between the generated image and the input image, while TV loss encourages 
the generated image to have smooth transitions and reduces high-frequency noise. By combining these two loss functions, we can train a model 
to generate images that preserve important structural details while also being visually pleasing and clear.
