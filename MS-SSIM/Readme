Training with MS-SSIM loss--dont forget to !pip install kornia

Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) loss, which is a measure of the structural similarity between two images. The MS-SSIM loss is 
a modification of the SSIM loss that takes into account the fact that images can have different scales of structure. It is commonly used in image 
processing and computer vision tasks where preserving the structure of the image is important, such as in super-resolution, denoising, and image 
compression. The MS-SSIM loss works by comparing the luminance, contrast, and structure of two images at different scales, and the final loss value 
is a weighted sum of the differences at each scale.
