Training with both SSIM and MSE losses. Don't forget to !pip install torchgeometry

Combining DSSIM and MSE loss functions is a way to train a model to generate high-quality images that are both structurally similar to the input image 
and visually appealing. DSSIM measures the structural similarity between the generated image and the input image, while MSE loss measures the mean squared 
error between the two images. By combining these two loss functions, we can train a model to generate images that preserve important structural details 
while also minimizing the pixel-level differences between the generated and input images. This approach is particularly effective for image restoration 
and super-resolution tasks.
