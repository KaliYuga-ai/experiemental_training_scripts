Training with DSSIM Loss--don't forget to !pip install korina

DSSIM (Deep Structural Similarity Index) is a perceptual image quality metric that measures the structural similarity between two images.
It is an extension of the original SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) metric that has been widely used for evaluating image quality. DSSIM 
computes the difference between two images based on luminance, contrast, and structural information, and returns a value between 0 and 1, 
where 0 indicates that the two images are identical and 1 indicates that the two images are completely dissimilar. DSSIM has been used as a 
loss function in deep learning models to generate high-quality images that are visually similar to the input images.
